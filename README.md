### Hi there 👋

<!--
**talinanguyen/talinanguyen** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a Cognitive Sciences major 🧠 and CS or STS double major 🤓 (undecided) 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to get out of my shell more and meet new people, French 🇫🇷, and how to crochet! 
- 💬 Ask me about my online clothing shop! 🛍️ I run a small business where I rehome vintage clothing :) https://depop.app.link/talisthreadz
- 📫 How to reach me: thnguy27@colby.edu and @talinawin on all socials!
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her 🎀
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am obsessed with Stitch from Lilo and Stitch, strawberries 🍓, bears 🧸, and cute bugs 🐛
